# Recommendations
Below are a few recommendations for making accessibility as painless and scaleable as possible.

## Component Libraries & Design Systems
Centralized common components and reliable design system will make maintaining an accessible code base much easier.

The component library can be anything from an internal selection of re-usable components to a fully fleshed out external NPM package. The goal is simply to have a pool of common components that have accessibility features built in and have gone through testing (both manual and automated).  

Having accessible components does not mean no further accessibility testing is required, but it does mean testing can be focused on the new page or feature as a whole instead of wasting time re-testing the individual pieces.

It also drastically reduces the amount of accessibility acceptance criteria that you need to write, because what you do write can - as with testing - be focused on the feature as a whole and not on individual pieces.
